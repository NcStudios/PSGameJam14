# Must Do
Visual representation of healthy/infected tree count (UI, but...)

Trigger win/lose condition

Add character controller parts

Improve movement/camera

Keep vehicle upright, or force back somehow

Add some interaction between vehicle and infected trees
  like sit next to tree, hold button, wait for it to turn
